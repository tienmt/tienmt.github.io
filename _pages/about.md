I am currently a postdoc at FHI. I am now working with PBPK model; and chemical mixtures and metabolic health outcomes - Norwegian Environmental Biobank

My previous works focused on state-space models at SFI-CGF NTNU. Prior to this, I completed a postdoc in biostatistics focused on  genomics data at the University of Oslo. My research spans statistics and machine learning, with a PhD in Statistics from CREST-ENSAE-ParisTech/Paris Saclay and University College Dublin.
